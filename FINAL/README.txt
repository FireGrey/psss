This program has been tested with Visual Studio Ultimate 2013 Version 12.0 using Visual Studio 2013 v120 platform toolset and running on Windows 7 SP1.


-The program requires Windows to compile and run (should work fine on the PCs in the lab)

-The program source files are found in the Source directory
-The program does not take any command line arguments, but reads the 'UseCaseDiagram.xml' found in the Source directory


There is also a pre-compiled .exe file included in the zip.
NOTE: Make sure the 'UseCaseDiagram.xml' is in the same directory as the .exe file or the program will throw an error and crash.
